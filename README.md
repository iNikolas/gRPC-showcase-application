# What is gRPC

gRPC introduces another way for applications to communicate. It stands above HTTP2 transfer protocol and uses Protocol buffer instead of regular JSON, which is a binary format, more beneficial from the message size perspective.

gRPC is especially useful in the non-browser environments first of all and extremely versatile for a bunch of different program languages.

In this "Todo app" example, I'm showing how to write a server-client gRPC application by means of a node.js environment and JavaScript language.
